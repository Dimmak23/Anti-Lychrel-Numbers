Anti-Lychrel Numbers

An anti-Lychrel number is a number that forms a palindrome through the
iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the
resulting numbers. For example, 56 becomes palindromic after one iteration:
56+65=121. If the number doesn't become palindromic after 30 iterations, then
it is not an anti-Lychrel number.

Examples:
Input: 12
Output: true (12 + 21 = 33, a palindrome)

Input: 57
Output: true (57 + 75 = 132, 132 + 231 = 363, a palindrome)

Input: 10911
Output: false (10911 takes 55 iterations to reach a palindrome)

Write a program to check if the user input is an anti-Lychrel number or not.

Bonus: Print all the anti-Lychrell numbers in a given range.

Input instructions.

For getting code work you should:

1) Enter int number and press SUBMIT for single mode research.

2) Or enter first number in the range, space - ' ' and last number in the range
and then SUBMIT for range mode research.

EXAMPLE #1:

For input:
1 10

You will get on the screen:

All anti-Lychrel numbers in the given range [1, 10] are:

[
10      9       8       7       6       5       4
3       2       1
].

Quantity of anti-Lychrel numbers: 10.

Time spend on calculations: 0.005 seconds.

That's all for now, run again.
